# Voice-Activated Personal Assistant 🎙️🤖

A **voice-activated personal assistant** designed to make your daily life easier by handling tasks such as setting reminders, checking the weather, reading news headlines, and more! 🌟 Powered by **speech recognition** and **text-to-speech** technologies, this project offers an interactive, hands-free experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice Commands:** 🎤  
  - Understands and executes commands using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

- **Supported Tasks:**  
  - 🕒 **Set Reminders** and manage personal tasks.  
  - 🌦️ **Get Weather Updates** for any city in real-time.  
  - 📰 **Read Top News Headlines** for staying informed.  
  - ✅ **Manage To-Do Lists** for better productivity.  
  - 💱 **Currency Conversion** (e.g., USD to EUR).  

- **Interactive and User-Friendly:**  
  - Listens to voice input and provides audible responses for a fully interactive experience.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition:**  
   - Captures voice input using the `speech_recognition` library.  
   - Converts voice to text for further processing.

2. **Intent Classification:**  
   - Processes commands using NLP to classify intents with a Naive Bayes Classifier.

3. **Task Execution:**  
   - Handles requests like fetching weather data via APIs, managing tasks, and more.

4. **Text-to-Speech:**  
   - Responds audibly using the `pyttsx3` library.
## About `training_data.json`

The `training_data.json` file contains labeled data used to train the assistant's intent classifier. Each entry consists of:

- **Text:** The user input (e.g., "set an alarm for 9 PM tomorrow").
- **Intent:** The categorized task or action (e.g., `set_alarm`).

This file is crucial for training the Naive Bayes Classifier, which helps the assistant understand and classify user commands accurately.

Example of `training_data.json`:
```
[
    {"text": "set an alarm for 9 PM tomorrow", "intent": "set_alarm"},
    {"text": "what's the weather like in Tokyo?", "intent": "get_weather"},
    {"text": "send an email to Jane about the meeting", "intent": "send_email"}
]
```
You can extend this file to include more commands and intents for better functionality.
